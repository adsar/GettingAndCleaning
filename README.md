  top-level description of file contents, including the processing
  steps performed and where to find descriptions of input and output datasets.

CookBook.md
  describes the variables, and the data transformations or work 
  performed to clean up the data

run_analysis.R
  The script run_analysis.R is self-contained, in the sense that it
  does not call other scripts.

  Instructions to Run the script in R:
  1. Ensure that the working directory is set to the same local
     folder where the script file is found.
  2. **IMPORTANT:** in the current directory, create a sub-directory called **inData**, and copy the input dataset (Samsung data files) inside the **inData** folder (here is where the script expects to find the input files).
  3. Copy the content of the run_analysis.R file, paste it on
     the RStudio console, and press Enter.
     It should take 30 seconds to a minute, depending on the
     hardware.
  4. To see the result, open the file
     ./outData/X_mean_activity_subject.txt
  
  For a step-wise description of the inner working of the script, 
  please refer to CodeBook.md.

Note:
-----
The input and output datasets are stored in two subfolders,
which are not included in the repository. See CodeBook.md for 
more details on the input and output datasets.
