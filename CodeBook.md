Getting and Cleaning Data
Course Project
Coursera, June 2014
CodeBook
==============================================================================
This project consists of a script called run_analysis.R, that consumes a 
dataset of meassurements made with a Samsung mobile device and produces a tidy
dataset as output.
run_analysis.R is required to perform the following tasks:
----------------------------------------------------------
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for 
   each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each 
  variable for each activity and each subject. 

Input Data
==========
I will not go into full detail here because it is already described in 
detail in two text files which are included in inData folder:
1. README.txt: this is the entry point to understand the contents of all the
   other files.
2. features_info.txt: a codebook-like description of the variables 

The following aspects of the input dataset are worth documenting because
they are relevant to understand how the script works:

features.txt
  2-column vector, associates the sequential order of each variable in the 
  training set (X_train.txt) to a short name.
  Note that this name is composed mainlyof 3 parts, as follows: 
    MEASSUREMENT-FUNCTION-DIRECTION
  where FUNCTION is the function used to calculate the variable out 
  from the raw data, and we are interested in the following:
  - mean() / Mean: Mean value
  - std(): Standard deviation
  
activity_labels.txt
  2-column vector, associates a numeric id to the name of the activity 
  
train
  directory, contains the training set (70% of subjects)
  The root folder contains following data:
  - A 561-FEATURE VECTOR with time and frequency domain variables. 
  - Its activity LABEL. 
  - An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
train\X_train.txt
  561-column vector, the variables of the training set, 2947 ROWS
train\Y_train.txt
  1-column, (labels) the activity corresponding to each row in X_train.txt, 2947 ROWS
train\subject_train.txt
  1-column vector, identifies the person origin of each data row in X_train.txt, 2947 ROWS
  
test\
  directory, contains the test set, the contents are identical in structure to
  the training set (30% of the subjects)

Note that the raw data variables from the input dataset are not needed for this 
project and can be ignored.



Output Data
===========
outData/X_mean_activity_subject.txt
The output data consists of a tab-separated text file, with headers.
The table contains the means, grouped by subject and activity, of a subset of 
variables from the input dataset, which in turn represent normalized means 
and standard deviations of the meassurements.
Following is a list of the 88 features of the output dataset:

Labels
------
  activityName  : the name of the activity that the subject was performing when the
                  massurements were recorded.
  subjectId	    : a consecutive integer in the [1-30] range that identifies the
                  subject who performed the activity.

Features: (86 variables)
---------
The values are averages of the input data values, grouped by the two labes above.

Please refer to the features_info.txt file in the input data set for details on
the naming convention (the meanning of eaach name)
The names of the variables from the input dataset has been preserved, with minimal
modification to remove special characters which are not well suited to be used as
variable names in a programming language.

Script run_analysis.R
=====================
Please find instructions to run in README.md

Description of the run_analysis.R script:
-----------------------------------------
The script consists of two parts, a function that reads and subsets a
dataset, and a main section that calls the function with each dataset
and then combines and summarizes the results.

 Main section
 ------------
 Calls the function getXMeanStd(), once for each dataset (Test and Train)
 then combines the resulting data frames, summarizes and writes 
 the output file.
 The following steps describe the main section of the script:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
01. Call function to read and subset the Test dataset
02. Call function to read and subset the Train dataset
03. Append rows from the two datasets read above
04. Calculates the average of each variable, by activity and subject, 
05. Writes the summarized data to the output file in the outData directory


 function GetXMeanStd()
 ----------------------
 reads the X values (variable calues), fixes the names, add label columns,
 and select a subset of the variables.
 Params
 - xFile          path to the file that contains the X vector
 - featureFile    path to the features.txt file 
 - yFile          path to the file that contains the y label vector
 - activityFile   path to the activities.txt file 
 - subjectFile    path to the file that contains the subject variable
 
 The following is the list of steps performed by this function:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  01. Read X_test.txt
  02. Read features.txt
  03. Assign names to teh variables, from the features.txt content
  04. Remove special chars [-+()] from the variables' names
  05. Subset the data frame, keeping only those columns containing "std"
      or "mean" in the name
  06. Read label ids from y_test.txt
  07. Read activity_labels.txt
  08. Merge y with activity
  09. Add the activityName column to the variables data frame 
  10. Read subject_test.txt
  11. Add the subjectId variables data frame, as a factor to avoid inclusion
      in subsequent summarisation
